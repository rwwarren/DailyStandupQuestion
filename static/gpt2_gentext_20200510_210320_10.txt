An ongoing controversy has emerged over whether or not the Pope would permit same-sex couples to marry across the Atlantic.

The controversy started at the Vatican when Pope Francis granted an unlimited run of 50,000 miles to travel to all 50 countries, from the U.S. to the Caribbean.

Now it's being taken at face value by gay rights groups, with a growing number saying it amounts to a violation of the Human Rights of LGBT people.

At least five countries have laws banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, according to the New York-based Human Rights Campaign. And following in the footsteps of Germany, Sweden, France and the Netherlands, workers in 90 countries are raising the bar on how long they can be fired if they do any same-sex attractions.
